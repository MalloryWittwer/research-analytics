## 1. Problem statement & current situation

### 1.1 A long lasting "publication crisis"

Over 2 million papers are being published every year and the number is still growing → known as the “publish or perish” phenomenon.

Authors are heavily encouraged to publish in journals that have a high "Journal Impact Factor". Therefore, papers are judged by the journal in which they are published and not by their content. There are no standard metric to judge a paper's impact.

### 1.2 By academics for academics

Academic papers are written by and for academics, hardly accessible outside academia both in terms of comprehensiveness and resource accessibility (i.e. paywalls).
Therefore, industries often fund their own "in-house" research, without sharing it to the wider research community.

Many international institutions (UN, WHO, WEF, etc) recommend to adopt research shcemes that are (i) open access, and (ii) prioritised to make sure that high-priority research (e.g. global health, food security, climate change etc.) is shared and communicated efficiently.

In summary, academic research suffers from three pain points:

1. Low impact
2. Restrained accessibility
3. Low prioritisation

## 2. Project goal

The Research Intelligence Platform (TRIP) aims to address the above pain points by automating the research process with topic-specific intelligence. 

### 2.1 Impactfulness

TRIP drives impactful publication by systematically assessing the impact of academic papers via an AI-determined Individual Impact Factor, as opposed to a Journal Impact Factor.

### 2.2 Accessibility

TRIP is the only platform that research consumers* need to go to to have open access to academic resources (e.g. Academia.edu, Unpaywall, Sci-Hub, etc.).
Through NLP- and NLG-powered summaries (or key points, to be detemrined), TRIP also guarantees the efficient communication of research papers.

* *direct consumers (i.e. producers and readers)

### 2.3  Prioritisation

Following global institution guidelines, TRIP identifies high-priority research areas, thus becoming the first automated research prioritisation system. 

## 3. Definition

The Research Intelligence Platform is an analytics service distributed as a SaaS (Software as a Service) and provided in the form of a web application.

### 3.1 What does it do

Users research a specific research topic (e.g. “automation container terminal”) through a search bar. The application then returns a highly interactive analytics dashboard displaying research intelligence on the topic including, but not limited to: 

* KPIs (key authors, journals, citation metrics, funding, Individual Impact Factors etc.)
* The research web (paper clustering with topic recognition)
* Topic summaries (NLG-generated key findings)
* etc

### 3.2 Who is it for?

Users are frequent academic research consumers*. Four groups have been identified:

* Academics (universities and other research institutions)
* Policy makers (governmental and global institutions as well as NGOs)
* Industry workers (small and medium businesses and corporations)
* Students

* *direct consumers (i.e. producers and readers)

Each group has specific needs that have to be precisely identified through in-depth market research.

## 4. Main tasks

To ensure consistent and healthy growth of the project, five main tasks have been identified:

* Researching -------------------- all processes related to acquiring knowledge (from KPIs to market research)
* Backend ------------------------ development of the software’s backend 
* UI & UX ------------------------ development of the software’s frontend
* Data infrastructure ------------ set up of the data infrastructures and pipelines
* Outreaching ------------------- all processes related to outreach activities (i.e. marketing, funding etc.)
