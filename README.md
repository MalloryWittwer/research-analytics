## 1. Problem statement & current situation

Over 2 million papers are being published every year and still growing → known as “publication crisis” leading to “lower-impact” publications

Papers are written by and for academics, hardly accessible outside academia both in terms of comprehensiveness and resource accessibility (i.e. paywalls).

Given the global issues that we are facing, many international institutions (UN, WHO, WEF, etc) recommend to adopt PRIORITISATION of research

From the above, three pain points need to be addressed in academic research:

* IMPACTFULNESS
* ACCESSIBILITY
* PRIORITISATION

## 2. Project goal

The Research Intelligence Platform aims to address the above pain points by automating the research process with topic-specific intelligence. 

### 2.1 Impactfulness

TRIP drives impactful publication through ML-determined Individual* Impact Factors.* as opposed to Journal Impact Factors

### 2.2 Accessibility

TRIP is the only platform that research consumers need to go to to have access to academic resources, analytics, and (innovation) recommendations. Access is provided through open access platforms such as Unpaywall, SciHub, Academia etc.

### 2.3  Prioritisation

Considering global institutional guidelines, TRIP’s algorithms identify high-priority knowledge gaps, thus becoming the first automated research prioritisation system. 

## 3. Definition

The Research Intelligence Platform is an analytics service distributed as a SaaS (Software as a Service) and provided in the format of a web application.

### 3.1 What does it do

Users research a specific research topic (e.g. “automation container terminal”) through a search bar. The application then returns a highly interactive analytics dashboard displaying research intelligence on the topic including, but not limited to: 

* KPIs (key authors, journals, citations, funding etc.)
* Metrics (citations per year, publications per year etc.)
* Research web (see section ???)
* Most frequent key words
* Topic summary (key findings - see section ???)
* etc

### 3.2 Who is it for?

Users are frequent academic research consumers*. Four groups have been identified:

* Academics (universities and other research institutions)
* Policy makers (governmental and global institutions as well as NGOs)
* Industry workers (small and medium businesses and corporations)
* Students

*direct consumers (i.e. producers and readers)

Each group has specific needs that have to be precisely identified through in-depth research.

## 4. Main tasks

To ensure consistent and healthy growth of the project, five main tasks have been identified:

* Researching ------------------ all processes related to acquiring knowledge 
* Coding ----------------------- development of the software’s backend 
* UI & UX ---------------------- development of the software’s frontend
* Building data infrastructure --- set up of the data infrastructures and pipelines
* Outreaching ------------------ all processes related to outreach activities (i.e. marketing, funding etc.)
