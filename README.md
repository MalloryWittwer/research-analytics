## 1. Problem statement & current situation

### 1.1 A long lasting "publication crisis"

Over 2 million papers are being published every year and the number is still growing → known as the “publish or perish” phenomenon.

Authors are heavily encouraged to publish in journals that have a high "Journal Impact Factor". Therefore, papers are judged by the journal in which they are published and not by their content. There are no standard metric to judge a paper's impact.

### 1.2 By academics for academics

Academic papers are written by and for academics, hardly accessible outside academia both in terms of comprehensiveness and resource accessibility (i.e. paywalls).
Therefore, industries often fund their own "in-house" research, without sharing it to the wider research community.

Many international institutions (UN, WHO, WEF, etc) recommend to adopt research shcemes that are (i) open access, and (ii) prioritised to make sure that high-priority research (e.g. global health, food security, climate change etc.) is shared and communicated efficiently.

In summary, academic research suffers from three pain points:

1. Low impact publications
2. Hardly accessible research
3. Low prioritisation of research

## 2. Project goal

The Research Intelligence Platform aims to address the above pain points by automating the research process with topic-specific intelligence. 

### 2.1 Impactfulness

TRIP drives impactful publication through ML-determined Individual* Impact Factors.* as opposed to Journal Impact Factors

### 2.2 Accessibility

TRIP is the only platform that research consumers need to go to to have access to academic resources, analytics, and (innovation) recommendations. Access is provided through open access platforms such as Unpaywall, SciHub, Academia etc.

### 2.3  Prioritisation

Considering global institutional guidelines, TRIP’s algorithms identify high-priority knowledge gaps, thus becoming the first automated research prioritisation system. 

## 3. Definition

The Research Intelligence Platform is an analytics service distributed as a SaaS (Software as a Service) and provided in the format of a web application.

### 3.1 What does it do

Users research a specific research topic (e.g. “automation container terminal”) through a search bar. The application then returns a highly interactive analytics dashboard displaying research intelligence on the topic including, but not limited to: 

* KPIs (key authors, journals, citations, funding etc.)
* Metrics (citations per year, publications per year etc.)
* Research web (see section ???)
* Most frequent key words
* Topic summary (key findings - see section ???)
* etc

### 3.2 Who is it for?

Users are frequent academic research consumers*. Four groups have been identified:

* Academics (universities and other research institutions)
* Policy makers (governmental and global institutions as well as NGOs)
* Industry workers (small and medium businesses and corporations)
* Students

*direct consumers (i.e. producers and readers)

Each group has specific needs that have to be precisely identified through in-depth research.

## 4. Main tasks

To ensure consistent and healthy growth of the project, five main tasks have been identified:

* Researching ------------------ all processes related to acquiring knowledge 
* Coding ----------------------- development of the software’s backend 
* UI & UX ---------------------- development of the software’s frontend
* Building data infrastructure --- set up of the data infrastructures and pipelines
* Outreaching ------------------ all processes related to outreach activities (i.e. marketing, funding etc.)
