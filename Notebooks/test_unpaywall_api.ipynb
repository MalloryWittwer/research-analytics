Vision based positioning techniques are inexpensive and rather accurate in nature, while the effect with insufficient illumination is left in question. This paper proposed a vision-based procedure with image sensors to determine the position of one container in the horizontal plane. The points found by the edge detection operator are clustered, and only the peak points in the parameter space of the Hough transformation is selected, in order that the effect of noises could be much decreased. The effectiveness of our procedure is verified in experiments, in which the efficiency of the procedure is also investigated.\\r\\n '}\n",

IEC 61850 is a general communication model and standard for information exchange between intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). However, it has no mechanism for feeder topology information exchange. This paper solves this problem by developing the corresponding information model. Firstly, a feeder model is established as a container of the equipment along a distribution line. Secondly, logical models, such as terminal and connection nodes, are added to describe the physical connection relationship between the electrical equipment. Taking a circuit breaker as an example, this paper introduces how to add the terminal attribute to an existing logical node (XCBR). The physical connection between the circuit breaker and other electrical equipment is described by adding the logic node LCNN. Then, a new logical node LTPN is added to describe the logical connection between the devices. A new logical node, FTPA, is added to describe the status of the topology analysis and the topology results. Based on these new logical nodes, this paper proposes the mechanism of topology information exchange between IEDs. Three IEDs and the IEEE 13-node model are used to build an experimental environment. The result verifies the effectiveness of this method. More distributed applications can be used to test the validity and interoperability of the proposed model.'}\n",

The importance of intermodal terminals has been increasing since the 1980s as a result of the development of containerized international trade. This increase in the handling of containers cause problems connected with securing adequate space for container storage or efficient usage of available terminal loading equipment such as cranes, AGVs, straddle carriers or terminal tractors with trailers. The equipment of a terminal depends mainly on the size of containers flow. The use of this equipment determine the terminal technology and work organization. That is why the classification of intermodal container terminals is presented in chapter 2. This classification was made according to different criteria. To understand transport problems, the identification of processes performed in the marine intermodal terminal is presented in chapter 3. For the purpose of research an example of an intermodal marine terminal with its individual functional areas is presented.  Finally, the literature review on research conducted on the transport processes performed in the terminal are presented in chapter 4. These processes refer to quay side and land side horizontal transport operations. Additionally, the arrangement of containers at the storage yard was investigated.\\n\\n'}\n",

Using original and extensive data on container imports in the Port of Douala, it seeks to provide a basic understanding of why containers stay on average more than two weeks in port space while long dwell times are widely recognized as a critical hindrance to economic development. It also demonstrates the interrelationships that exist between logistics performance of consignees, operational performance of port operators and efficiency of customs clearance operations. Shipment level analysis is used to identify the main determinants of long cargo dwell times and the impact of shipment characteristics such as fiscal regime, density of value, bulking and packaging type, last port of call, and region of origin or commodity group on cargo dwell time in ports is tested. External factors, such as performance of clearing and forwarding agents, shippers and shipping line strategies, also play an important role in the determination of long dwell times.\\n\\n'}\n",

The production control in the loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs) involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing by 23.34% and 31.46% in small-scale and large-scale problems, respectively. Moreover, the visualization service provided by the DT system can monitor the status of automation equipment in real time to ensure the safety of operation.'}\n",

A mixed integer programming model is built for the upper level, and a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to solve the model. The applicable conditions of the model is investigated by numerical experiments, so as the performance of the algorithm in different problem scales. It is left to future research the lower level of the problem and the potential benefit of storage allocation to automated container terminals.'}\n",

Within the conceptual framework of computational logistics, an attention mechanism oriented hybrid convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network deep learning architecture (AMO-HCR-DLA) is proposed technically to predict the container terminal liner handling conditions that mainly include liner handling time (LHT) and total working time of quay crane farm (TWT-QCF) for a calling liner. Consequently, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computation (CTO-LGC) automation and intelligence are established tentatively by AMO-HCR-DLA. A typical regional container terminal hub of China is selected to design, implement, execute, and evaluate the AMO-HCR-DLA with the actual production data. In the case of severe vibration of LHT and TWT-QCF, while forecasting the handling conditions of 210 ships based on the CTO-LGC running log of four years, the forecasting error of LHT within one hour is more than 97% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours accounts for 89.405%. When predicting the operating conditions of 300 liners by the log of five years, the forecasting deviation of LHT within one hour is more than striking 99% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours reaches up to 94.010% as well. All are far superior to the predicting outcomes by the classical algorithms of machine learning and deep learning. Hence, the AMO-HCR-DLA shows excellent performance for the prediction of CTHS with the low and stable computational consuming. It also demonstrates the feasibility, credibility, and realizability of the computing architecture and design paradigm of AMO-HCR-DLA preliminarily.'}\n",

In order to facilitate port automation, we present a method of hull modeling (reconstruction of hull’s structure) and operation target (cargo holds under loading) identification based on 3D point cloud collected by Laser Measurement System mounted on the ship loader. In the hull modeling algorithm, we incrementally register pairs of point clouds and reconstruct the 3D structure of bulk ship’s hull blocks in details through process of encoder data of the loader, FPFH feature matching and ICP algorithm. In the identification algorithm, we project real-time point clouds of the operation zone to spherical coordinate and transforms the 3D point clouds to 2D images for fast and reliable identification of operation target. Our method detects and complements four edges of the operation target through process of the 2D images and estimates both posture and size of operation target in the bulk terminal based on the complemented edges. Experimental trials show that our algorithm allows us to achieve the reconstruction of hull blocks and real-time identification of operation target with high accuracy and reliability.'}\n",

The luggage trolleys are used for the transport purposes, which are hitched to the mover and moved directly to the surroundings of the airplane. The loading and unloading of luggage is performed manually. Regarding actual safety requirements there was a need to create a new transport system, working in a closed cycle and based on the device for automatic loading and unloading of luggage units.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMethods: Various potential variants of the device were generated based on results of analytical researches by the use of the morphological schema. The detail evaluation and the optimization of individual variants allow to prepare the concept of the complex method to solve problems of the reliable transport of luggage units within an airport.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tResults: The closed transport system was created as a result of the innovative project. The main element of this system is a&nbsp;container trolley, which is equipped in five storage layers. By the use of the special mover and gravitational forces, luggage units can be transported and placed inside this trolley as well as being loaded and unloaded. This solution enables to move 200 pieces of luggage in one transport cycle from the check-in terminal to the hatchway of the airplane.'}\n",

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed a new method to optimize the scheduling of ASC and AGV. In the automated container terminal, each container block is equipped with twin ASCs. At the same time, buffer zones are set at both ends of the container block to achieve the decoupling operation among ASC, AGV, and container truck. Considering the buffer capacity constraint and twin ASC operation interference, and introducing the design of handshake area, this paper developed a collaborative scheduling model of AGV and ASC in automatic terminal relay operation mode. This model is designed based on the genetic algorithm. The model aims to minimize the AGV waiting time and the ASC running time. The results indicated that the introduction of handshake area can effectively reduce the ASC operation interference by 10.56% on average. Also, it can be found that increasing buffer capacity can reduce the waiting time of AGV by about 4.25% on average, and the effect of relay operation is more obvious in large-scale operation. It was proved that buffer zone and handshake area can reduce task delay time and improve coordination between AGV and ASC.'}\n"
